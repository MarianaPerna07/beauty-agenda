# Beauty Agenda â€“ React & FastAPI Beautician Scheduling Platform

The site will include:
- **Home Page** showcasing services and professionals
- **Booking System** with selection of time slot, service, professional, and salon
- **Flexible Scheduling** supporting variable durations per service
- **Automated Email & SMS Reminders** for clients (note: promotional SMS/emails are considered an extra due to legal and cost analysis requirements)
- **Admin Dashboard** for blocking/adding appointments, attendance confirmation, and daily agenda overview
- **FAQ Page**, **Services Info** (e.g., rules, products), and mandatory **Legal Section** (e.g., NIF)

We aim to deliver an intuitive, visually appealing site prepared for future enhancements such as an online store or additional features.

**Proposed Fixed Price:** â‚¬1,200

This covers all technical development of the platform and can be paid in installments as discussed. Our main goal is to deliver a product that meets your expectations.

The site will also incur ongoing monthly costs for:
- Hosting, domain registration, and SMS/email services
- Technical maintenance (adjustments, updates, and improvements) to keep the site stable and upâ€‘toâ€‘date

**Estimated Monthly Fee:** â‚¬50  
This may be adjusted based on traffic, booking volume, and actual maintenance needs.

> **Note:** Search Engine Marketing (appearing at the top of Google search results) is not included at this time. If you wish to pursue PPC campaigns later, we can discuss it separatelyâ€”these costs are paid directly to Google and are an optional extra.

If you have any questions or points to review, weâ€™re at your disposal!
